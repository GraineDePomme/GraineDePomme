## Hi there 🙋‍♂️

### A Few Words About Me

Former physics student, currently working as a data analyst by day and studying computer science by night. I'm passionate about computational science and quantum computing. When I'm not working or studying, I play guitar and fly planes. I like everything that is green — except brocolli — and I'm terrible at keeping houseplants alive, so I prefer hiking to enjoy nature instead. I was born in France but tend to live elsewhere; right now I'm based in Poland.
